22    = Abstract =
23
24    I anatomize a successful open-source project, fetchmail, that was run as a deliberate test of the
25    surprising theories about software engineering suggested by the history of Linux. I discuss these
26    theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the "cathedral" model of most
27    of the commercial world versus the "bazaar" model of the Linux world. I show that these models
28    derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task.  I then make a
29    sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that "Given enough eyeballs, all
30    bugs are shallow", suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish
31    agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of
32    software.
33
59    The fact that this bazaar style seemed to work, and work well, came as a distinct shock. As I
60    learned my way around, I worked hard not just at individual projects, but also at trying to
61    understand why the Linux world not only didn't fly apart in confusion but seemed to go from strength
62    to strength at a speed barely imaginable to cathedral-builders.
63
64    By mid-1996 I thought I was beginning to understand. Chance handed me a perfect way to test my
65    theory, in the form of an open-source project that I could consciously try to run in the bazaar
66    style. So I did—and it was a significant success.
67
68    This is the story of that project. I'll use it to propose some aphorisms about effective open-source
69    development. Not all of these are things I first learned in the Linux world, but we'll see how the
70    Linux world gives them particular point. If I'm correct, they'll help you understand exactly what it
71    is that makes the Linux community such a fountain of good software—and, perhaps, they will help you
72    become more productive yourself.
