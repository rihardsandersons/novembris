239   = Release Early, Release Often =
240
241   Early and frequent releases are a critical part of the Linux development model. Most developers
242   (including me) used to believe this was bad policy for larger than trivial projects, because early
243   versions are almost by definition buggy versions and you don't want to wear out the patience of your
244   users.
245
246   This belief reinforced the general commitment to a cathedral-building style of development. If the
247   overriding objective was for users to see as few bugs as possible, why then you'd only release a
248   version every six months (or less often), and work like a dog on debugging between releases. The
249   Emacs C core was developed this way. The Lisp library, in effect, was notâ€”because there were active
250   Lisp archives outside the FSF's control, where you could go to find new and development code
251   versions independently of Emacs's release cycle [QR].
252
253   The most important of these, the Ohio State Emacs Lisp archive, anticipated the spirit and many of
254   the features of today's big Linux archives. But few of us really thought very hard about what we
255   were doing, or about what the very existence of that archive suggested about problems in the FSF's
256   cathedral-building development model. I made one serious attempt around 1992 to get a lot of the
257   Ohio code formally merged into the official Emacs Lisp library. I ran into political trouble and was
258   largely unsuccessful.
259
260   But by a year later, as Linux became widely visible, it was clear that something different and much
261   healthier was going on there. Linus's open development policy was the very opposite of
262   cathedral-building. Linux's Internet archives were burgeoning, multiple distributions were being
263   floated. And all of this was driven by an unheard-of frequency of core system releases.
264
265   Linus was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective possible way:
266
267       7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
268
269   Linus's innovation wasn't so much in doing quick-turnaround releases incorporating lots of user
270   feedback (something like this had been Unix-world tradition for a long time), but in scaling it up
271   to a level of intensity that matched the complexity of what he was developing. In those early times
272   (around 1991) it wasn't unknown for him to release a new kernel more than once a day! Because he
273   cultivated his base of co-developers and leveraged the Internet for collaboration harder than anyone
274   else, this worked.
275
276   But how did it work? And was it something I could duplicate, or did it rely on some unique genius of
277   Linus Torvalds?
278
279   I didn't think so. Granted, Linus is a damn fine hacker. How many of us could engineer an entire
280   production-quality operating system kernel from scratch? But Linux didn't represent any awesome
281   conceptual leap forward. Linus is not (or at least, not yet) an innovative genius of design in the
282   way that, say, Richard Stallman or James Gosling (of NeWS and Java) are. Rather, Linus seems to me
283   to be a genius of engineering and implementation, with a sixth sense for avoiding bugs and
284   development dead-ends and a true knack for finding the minimum-effort path from point A to point B.
285   Indeed, the whole design of Linux breathes this quality and mirrors Linus's essentially conservative
286   and simplifying design approach.
287
288   So, if rapid releases and leveraging the Internet medium to the hilt were not accidents but integral
289   parts of Linus's engineering-genius insight into the minimum-effort path, what was he maximizing?
290   What was he cranking out of the machinery?
291
292   Put that way, the question answers itself. Linus was keeping his hacker/users constantly stimulated
293   and rewardedâ€”stimulated by the prospect of having an ego-satisfying piece of the action, rewarded by
294   the sight of constant (even daily) improvement in their work.
295
296   Linus was directly aiming to maximize the number of person-hours thrown at debugging and
297   development, even at the possible cost of instability in the code and user-base burnout if any
298   serious bug proved intractable. Linus was behaving as though he believed something like this:
299
300       8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be
301          characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
302
303   Or, less formally, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." I dub this: "Linus's Law".
304
305   My original formulation was that every problem "will be transparent to somebody". Linus demurred
306   that the person who understands and fixes the problem is not necessarily or even usually the person
307   who first characterizes it. "Somebody finds the problem," he says, "and somebody else understands
308   it. And I'll go on record as saying that finding it is the bigger challenge." That correction is
309   important; we'll see how in the next section, when we examine the practice of debugging in more
310   detail. But the key point is that both parts of the process (finding and fixing) tend to happen
311   rapidly.
312
313   In Linus's Law, I think, lies the core difference underlying the cathedral-builder and bazaar
314   styles. In the cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems are tricky,
315   insidious, deep phenomena. It takes months of scrutiny by a dedicated few to develop confidence that
316   you've winkled them all out. Thus the long release intervals, and the inevitable disappointment when
317   long-awaited releases are not perfect.
318
319   In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomenaâ€”or, at
320   least, that they turn shallow pretty quickly when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding
321   on every single new release. Accordingly you release often in order to get more corrections, and as
322   a beneficial side effect you have less to lose if an occasional botch gets out the door.
323
324   And that's it. That's enough. If "Linus's Law" is false, then any system as complex as the Linux
325   kernel, being hacked over by as many hands as the that kernel was, should at some point have
326   collapsed under the weight of unforseen bad interactions and undiscovered "deep" bugs. If it's true,
327   on the other hand, it is sufficient to explain Linux's relative lack of bugginess and its continuous
328   uptimes spanning months or even years.
329
330   Maybe it shouldn't have been such a surprise, at that. Sociologists years ago discovered that the
331   averaged opinion of a mass of equally expert (or equally ignorant) observers is quite a bit more
332   reliable a predictor than the opinion of a single randomly-chosen one of the observers. They called
333   this the Delphi effect. It appears that what Linus has shown is that this applies even to debugging
334   an operating systemâ€”that the Delphi effect can tame development complexity even at the complexity
335   level of an OS kernel. [CV]
336
337   One special feature of the Linux situation that clearly helps along the Delphi effect is the fact
338   that the contributors for any given project are self-selected. An early respondent pointed out that
339   contributions are received not from a random sample, but from people who are interested enough to
340   use the software, learn about how it works, attempt to find solutions to problems they encounter,
341   and actually produce an apparently reasonable fix. Anyone who passes all these filters is highly
342   likely to have something useful to contribute.
343
344   Linus's Law can be rephrased as "Debugging is parallelizable". Although debugging requires debuggers
345   to communicate with some coordinating developer, it doesn't require significant coordination between
346   debuggers. Thus it doesn't fall prey to the same quadratic complexity and management costs that make
347   adding developers problematic.
348
349   In practice, the theoretical loss of efficiency due to duplication of work by debuggers almost never
350   seems to be an issue in the Linux world. One effect of a "release early and often" policy is to
351   minimize such duplication by propagating fed-back fixes quickly [JH].
352
353   Brooks (the author of The Mythical Man-Month) even made an off-hand observation related to this:
354   "The total cost of maintaining a widely used program is typically 40 percent or more of the cost of
355   developing it. Surprisingly this cost is strongly affected by the number of users. More users find
356   more bugs." [emphasis added].
357
358   More users find more bugs because adding more users adds more different ways of stressing the
359   program. This effect is amplified when the users are co-developers. Each one approaches the task of
360   bug characterization with a slightly different perceptual set and analytical toolkit, a different
361   angle on the problem. The "Delphi effect" seems to work precisely because of this variation. In the
362   specific context of debugging, the variation also tends to reduce duplication of effort.
363
364   So adding more beta-testers may not reduce the complexity of the current "deepest" bug from the
365   developer's point of view, but it increases the probability that someone's toolkit will be matched
366   to the problem in such a way that the bug is shallow to that person.
367
368   Linus coppers his bets, too. In case there are serious bugs, Linux kernel version are numbered in
369   such a way that potential users can make a choice either to run the last version designated "stable"
370   or to ride the cutting edge and risk bugs in order to get new features. This tactic is not yet
371   systematically imitated by most Linux hackers, but perhaps it should be; the fact that either choice
372   is available makes both more attractive. [HBS]
373
374   = How Many Eyeballs Tame Complexity =
375
376   It's one thing to observe in the large that the bazaar style greatly accelerates debugging and code
377   evolution. It's another to understand exactly how and why it does so at the micro-level of
378   day-to-day developer and tester behavior. In this section (written three years after the original
379   paper, using insights by developers who read it and re-examined their own behavior) we'll take a
380   hard look at the actual mechanisms. Non-technically inclined readers can safely skip to the next
381   section.
382
383   One key to understanding is to realize exactly why it is that the kind of bug report
384   non–source-aware users normally turn in tends not to be very useful. Non–source-aware users tend to
385   report only surface symptoms; they take their environment for granted, so they (a) omit critical
386   background data, and (b) seldom include a reliable recipe for reproducing the bug.
387
388   The underlying problem here is a mismatch between the tester's and the developer's mental models of
389   the program; the tester, on the outside looking in, and the developer on the inside looking out. In
390   closed-source development they're both stuck in these roles, and tend to talk past each other and
391   find each other deeply frustrating.
392
393   Open-source development breaks this bind, making it far easier for tester and developer to develop a
394   shared representation grounded in the actual source code and to communicate effectively about it.
395   Practically, there is a huge difference in leverage for the developer between the kind of bug report
396   that just reports externally-visible symptoms and the kind that hooks directly to the developer's
397   source-code–based mental representation of the program.
398
399   Most bugs, most of the time, are easily nailed given even an incomplete but suggestive
400   characterization of their error conditions at source-code level. When someone among your
401   beta-testers can point out, "there's a boundary problem in line nnn", or even just "under conditions
402   X, Y, and Z, this variable rolls over", a quick look at the offending code often suffices to pin
403   down the exact mode of failure and generate a fix.
404
405   Thus, source-code awareness by both parties greatly enhances both good communication and the synergy
406   between what a beta-tester reports and what the core developer(s) know. In turn, this means that the
407   core developers' time tends to be well conserved, even with many collaborators.
408
409   Another characteristic of the open-source method that conserves developer time is the communication
410   structure of typical open-source projects. Above I used the term "core developer"; this reflects a
411   distinction between the project core (typically quite small; a single core developer is common, and
412   one to three is typical) and the project halo of beta-testers and available contributors (which
413   often numbers in the hundreds).
414
415   The fundamental problem that traditional software-development organization addresses is Brook's Law:
416   "Adding more programmers to a late project makes it later." More generally, Brooks's Law predicts
417   that the complexity and communication costs of a project rise with the square of the number of
418   developers, while work done only rises linearly.
419
420   Brooks's Law is founded on experience that bugs tend strongly to cluster at the interfaces between
421   code written by different people, and that communications/coordination overhead on a project tends
422   to rise with the number of interfaces between human beings. Thus, problems scale with the number of
423   communications paths between developers, which scales as the square of the humber of developers
424   (more precisely, according to the formula N*(N - 1)/2 where N is the number of developers).
425
426   The Brooks's Law analysis (and the resulting fear of large numbers in development groups) rests on a
427   hidden assummption: that the communications structure of the project is necessarily a complete
428   graph, that everybody talks to everybody else. But on open-source projects, the halo developers work
429   on what are in effect separable parallel subtasks and interact with each other very little; code
430   changes and bug reports stream through the core group, and only within that small core group do we
431   pay the full Brooksian overhead. [SU]
432
433   There are are still more reasons that source-code–level bug reporting tends to be very efficient.
434   They center around the fact that a single error can often have multiple possible symptoms,
435   manifesting differently depending on details of the user's usage pattern and environment. Such
436   errors tend to be exactly the sort of complex and subtle bugs (such as dynamic-memory-management
437   errors or nondeterministic interrupt-window artifacts) that are hardest to reproduce at will or to
438   pin down by static analysis, and which do the most to create long-term problems in software.
439
440   A tester who sends in a tentative source-code–level characterization of such a multi-symptom bug
441   (e.g. "It looks to me like there's a window in the signal handling near line 1250" or "Where are you
442   zeroing that buffer?") may give a developer, otherwise too close to the code to see it, the critical
443   clue to a half-dozen disparate symptoms. In cases like this, it may be hard or even impossible to
444   know which externally-visible misbehaviour was caused by precisely which bug—but with frequent
445   releases, it's unnecessary to know. Other collaborators will be likely to find out quickly whether
446   their bug has been fixed or not. In many cases, source-level bug reports will cause misbehaviours to
447   drop out without ever having been attributed to any specific fix.
448
449   Complex multi-symptom errors also tend to have multiple trace paths from surface symptoms back to
450   the actual bug. Which of the trace paths a given developer or tester can chase may depend on
451   subtleties of that person's environment, and may well change in a not obviously deterministic way
452   over time. In effect, each developer and tester samples a semi-random set of the program's state
453   space when looking for the etiology of a symptom. The more subtle and complex the bug, the less
454   likely that skill will be able to guarantee the relevance of that sample.
455
456   For simple and easily reproducible bugs, then, the accent will be on the "semi" rather than the
457   "random"; debugging skill and intimacy with the code and its architecture will matter a lot. But for
458   complex bugs, the accent will be on the "random". Under these circumstances many people running
459   traces will be much more effective than a few people running traces sequentially—even if the few
460   have a much higher average skill level.
461
462   This effect will be greatly amplified if the difficulty of following trace paths from different
463   surface symptoms back to a bug varies significantly in a way that can't be predicted by looking at
464   the symptoms. A single developer sampling those paths sequentially will be as likely to pick a
465   difficult trace path on the first try as an easy one. On the other hand, suppose many people are
466   trying trace paths in parallel while doing rapid releases. Then it is likely one of them will find
467   the easiest path immediately, and nail the bug in a much shorter time. The project maintainer will
468   see that, ship a new release, and the other people running traces on the same bug will be able to
469   stop before having spent too much time on their more difficult traces [RJ].
470
471   = When Is a Rose Not a Rose? =
472
473   Having studied Linus's behavior and formed a theory about why it was successful, I made a conscious
474   decision to test this theory on my new (admittedly much less complex and ambitious) project.
475
476   But the first thing I did was reorganize and simplify popclient a lot. Carl Harris's implementation
477   was very sound, but exhibited a kind of unnecessary complexity common to many C programmers. He
478   treated the code as central and the data structures as support for the code. As a result, the code
479   was beautiful but the data structure design ad-hoc and rather ugly (at least by the high standards
480   of this veteran LISP hacker).
481
482   I had another purpose for rewriting besides improving the code and the data structure design,
483   however. That was to evolve it into something I understood completely. It's no fun to be responsible
484   for fixing bugs in a program you don't understand.
485
486   For the first month or so, then, I was simply following out the implications of Carl's basic design.
487   The first serious change I made was to add IMAP support. I did this by reorganizing the protocol
488   machines into a generic driver and three method tables (for POP2, POP3, and IMAP). This and the
489   previous changes illustrate a general principle that's good for programmers to keep in mind,
490   especially in languages like C that don't naturally do dynamic typing:
491
492       9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
493
494   Brooks, Chapter 9: "Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be
495   mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious." Allowing
496   for thirty years of terminological/cultural shift, it's the same point.
497
498   At this point (early September 1996, about six weeks from zero) I started thinking that a name
499   change might be in order—after all, it wasn't just a POP client any more. But I hesitated, because
500   there was as yet nothing genuinely new in the design. My version of popclient had yet to develop an
501   identity of its own.
502
503   That changed, radically, when popclient learned how to forward fetched mail to the SMTP port. I'll
504   get to that in a moment. But first: I said earlier that I'd decided to use this project to test my
505   theory about what Linus Torvalds had done right. How (you may well ask) did I do that? In these
506   ways:
507
508       * I released early and often (almost never less often than every ten days; during periods of
509         intense development, once a day).
510
511       * I grew my beta list by adding to it everyone who contacted me about fetchmail.
512
513       * I sent chatty announcements to the beta list whenever I released, encouraging people to
514         participate.
515
516       * And I listened to my beta-testers, polling them about design decisions and stroking them
517         whenever they sent in patches and feedback.
518
519   The payoff from these simple measures was immediate. From the beginning of the project, I got bug
520   reports of a quality most developers would kill for, often with good fixes attached. I got
521   thoughtful criticism, I got fan mail, I got intelligent feature suggestions. Which leads to:
522
523       10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond
524           by becoming your most valuable resource.
525
526   One interesting measure of fetchmail's success is the sheer size of the project beta list,
527   fetchmail-friends. At the time of latest revision of this paper (November 2000) it has 287 members
528   and is adding two or three a week.
529
530   Actually, when I revised in late May 1997 I found the list was beginning to lose members from its
531   high of close to 300 for an interesting reason. Several people have asked me to unsubscribe them
532   because fetchmail is working so well for them that they no longer need to see the list traffic!
533   Perhaps this is part of the normal life-cycle of a mature bazaar-style project.
